Some useful keyboard shortcuts, for ship: \ H = Use repair kit \ Q = Activate/deactive shield (save energy) \ Z = Activate/deactive targeting-beam (save energy) \ B = Leave the ship's bridge \ F = Raise the Jolly Roger flag... arr! \ \ For Captain: \ H = Use health pack \ G = Activate/deactive night-vision goggles \ R = Activate/deactive Battle scanner \ C = Take control of field weapon (when standing near an allied turret) \ T = Take control of a tank \ O = Operate electrobinoculors (press to switch scopes)
Have you tried out the on-board store? \ Leave the ship's bridge by pressing 'B' in ship mode, and then right-click on the computer panel directly below the bridge. You can buy supplies and weapons (if you have sufficient rank), and also trade in three stocks (Slaves, Weapon Parts and Drugs) to profit on rising and falling markets.
A good thing to remember is that throughout the Confederacy, a great deal of honour depends on the manner in which combat is undertaken. As they require no skill to operate, missile and rocket weapons are considered less honourable than conventional hand-held or turret-controlled weapons. Accordingly, a kill made with one of these weapons will give you less Promotion points than usual. \ A good tactic for fighting capital warships or powerful enemies is to use missiles and rockets to severely damage the enemy, and then finish them off by hand or with turret weapons, maximizing your PP earned.
